- ⚡ Fun fact: Every 24 hours, humans and machines generate over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data—that’s enough information to stream music non-stop for 2.7 million years. 🌐🎶 

Why It’s Awesome:

Data Science & ML Engineering turn this tidal wave of raw bytes into actionable insights—everything from predicting flight delays to powering recommendation engines.

Cloud Computing makes it possible to store and process exabytes of data at scale, on-demand, without buying a data center upfront.
